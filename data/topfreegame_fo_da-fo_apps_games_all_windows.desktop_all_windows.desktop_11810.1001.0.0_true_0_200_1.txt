The goal of the game is to take as many tricks as possible and reach a score of 10 or more first. The game is played in pairs. Your partner sits opposite to you and the deals are played clockwise. Each player is dealt five cards and the game starts by choosing a card suit.\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ advanced AI players\r\n✓ intuitive interface\r\n✓ balanced rules\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓\tIn the first round you can choose the trump suit by choosing the card from the center pile. \r\n✓\tIf the current round passes without choosing the trump a second one follows.\r\n✓\tIn the second round you must choose any suit of cards except the one you passed in the round before.\r\n✓\tIf the trump is not chosen in these 2 rounds the cards are reshuffled and the game starts again without changing the dealer.\r\n✓\tOnce a trump suit is chosen the game can start. \r\n✓\tIf you choose a trump suit in the first round, the card in the center pile is passed to the dealer of the cards.\r\n✓\tIf you are the dealer of the cards, your name is marked with an encircled D. If the trump is chosen in the first round you receive the trump card and must shed any card you wish.\r\n✓\tThe player next to the dealer in a clock-wise direction is the first to choose a trump suit. \r\n✓\tIf that player passes the chance, the next one after him follows.\r\n✓\tThe game is played between two teams: a top-bottom team comprised of you and a computer player and a left-right team of computer players.\r\n✓\tThe player and his partner are called the makers if one of them chooses a trump suit. Otherwise they are called the defenders.\r\n✓\tTo win the makers must take at least 3 tricks. The defenders in order to win must take at least 3 tricks as well.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 5 tricks they score 2 points. If the defenders take 3 or more tricks they score 2 points.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 3 or 4 tricks they score 1 point. If the makers take less than 3 tricks they score 0 points.\r\n✓\tThere is the possibility of playing alone by pressing the -play alone- button when choosing the trump.\r\n✓\tWhen playing alone the team scores 4 points if the maker takes all 5 tricks. Otherwise if the team takes 3 or 4 tricks it scores only 1 point.\r\n✓\tThere is a specific order of the trump cards. The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit. \r\n✓\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9. \r\n✓\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit.\r\n✓\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9.\r\n✓\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit.\r\n✓\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit.\r\n✓\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit.\r\n✓\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points.\r\n✓\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made.\r\n✓\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre.\r\n✓\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred.\r\n✓\tThe makers are marked with an M. The player that chose the trump is marked with a bold M.\r\n✓\tThe defenders are marked with a D.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

If so, then Tank Ace Free could be the game for you. \r\n\r\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate east or west, and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles. \r\n\r\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you. \r\n\r\nThis free version plays one level of the full game, Tank Ace Reloaded, and contains advertising.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFRV1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35651.9007199266299078.06931228-a35b-4258-b5a8-03c32e863c3b.86c2cc5d-ed26-43f2-ae50-3efbc2a5674b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.EnigmatisTheGhostsofMapleCreek_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["ee9135a3-88aa-dd74-bbc8-05cdcb44e1a7","b7f81cea-05b9-b30e-b787-48bbe7339856"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobil","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nLet one of the most thrilling adventures of your life begin! \r\n\r\nTRY IT FREE, THEN UNLOCK THE FULL ADVENTURE FROM WITHIN THE GAME!\r\n\r\nImagine waking up after a powerful storm as the sun goes down.

Three different difficulty modes to control how many cards being opened, how many deck turnovers allowed and if King (vs any card) is required to initialize empty pile. The scoring reflects number of moves and the level - the lower the better. Use menu (top-right corner) for undo, change difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMKBJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire !","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32185.9007199266455279.d1c678f4-e65e-4f4e-8618-1f50c7dd70b2.2ada2db4-dd2f-4e87-81e5-46472c512f84","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10207.9007199266455279.d92b2c75-cd18-47f9-b33f-0a850ca8adb4.e026aa3c-3136-43d1-a32c-6d865a84b680","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43223.9007199266455279.267750dd-9310-4834-8acc-7be1097cb31d.14096c83-8326-40ec-ab1d-fe196e30614f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["476931bsyl.Solitaire_cgv7566y2ek3j"],"ContentIds":["2b9271a2-9075-b0b9-cb9d-8395bb40c61e","83e09152-53ce-4514-b985-4c104fb16065"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobil","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is the usual Solitaire card game. Also known as Patience Klondike.\r\n\r\nTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The point of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit- the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player will have won.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMMCB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Peppa Pig Dominoes","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40589.9007199266449359.187fd0f4-b566-4939-b5ca-1bd6721b963d.d526b4f7-17ac-4d15-8600-07a6c0f2c428","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58919.9007199266449359.127a77f5-b888-405e-a590-e779dbfccc1f.9c655ce4-1b4b-4e36-a600-5b3ec9d6d164","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20084.9007199266449359.d52d0295-ce5c-4da9-935f-a15f74fb6595.3abeaa1e-55e3-4963-9485-384c2ac91c6e","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.35284.9007199266449359.5cd02502-504f-47d4-b715-6b810ae23385.f9003b21-28bf-4cee-af75-7803fecab685","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["65327Damicolo.PeppaPigDominoes_3fzfqdacad5k6"],"ContentIds":["86b2259f-403a-861c-c5db-764acf15d5d1","6c31ec39-dbec-3561-aedb-2857aab7da7d","c8aef37a-584d-7d70-4684-e0b5fbd4d9e8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,HoloLens,Mobil","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a \"Peppa Pig\" themed version of the clever classic dominoes game.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire Collection Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30186.9007199266251693.bb4553e8-86e7-4b65-a9bb-6ccdeefd7c17.7029e085-f4cb-4e12-87fa-02b34ae24bc4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16164.9007199266251693.66ae06c0-6c6e-4e12-9ca1-a4924d81279d.89b01d1e-ced4-41aa-89a0-5394eda92e87","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13860.9007199266251693.07fcfec6-96ef-4efa-ad1f-f58d3fc2cf71.54beb575-389f-4e45-8761-065ae2353863","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60912.9007199266251693.22012260-3791-462d-92ff-332d36a0745e.f2c61312-addc-411f-a884-31371d573bee","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9171.9007199266251693.dadf7317-414c-4739-9d67-5e0d6b1e029b.2a6ca758-fe2b-43fb-9718-976ff9c25668","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4931.9007199266251693.c9425b5b-a57a-430e-a7ad-7992c64aaaee.215790f5-62b6-4aa1-bb32-5c3d80095267","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22327.9007199266251693.04d1c893-44fa-4f36-9f6d-e71941f601e8.25aad5f8-30e4-4d0b-9216-6382050bcfa5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60399.9007199266251693.31a64ec2-546a-4571-9bd9-5f87f0029533.9097ab22-6ae5-480e-b833-01bc7f90409a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55753.9007199266251693.923bd944-547f-4039-81b7-88ed123a189c.cda166b8-cb6d-4628-8a7c-51782b6b6ebf","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.SpiderSolitaireCollectionFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["b8f1098c-a6ee-4b90-e51d-1342746aafd9","9d7c8ccf-c695-298c-1f82-2d4a6c7b9645","630f6217-a186-344c-ff87-8f382dbec7ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play a free beautiful collection of Spider solitaire game variations, including:\r\n- Spider\r\n- Spider One Suit\r\n- Spider Two Suits\r\n- Scorpion\r\n\r\nWe support our apps and your feedback is welcome.
