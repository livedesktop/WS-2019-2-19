Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants.

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins. Arnar gives his younger son a mission to find a dwarf and return the ring. \r\nThe Vikings sailed to the setting sun for many days, until the storm scattered their drakkar on the shores of some island. They were lucky, it was the island they were looking for. Travel with Ingolf along the picturesque lands, help the locals solve their problems, make friends with a wise Druid and, most importantly, find Loki to deliver the Viking king from the curse of the ring! \r\n\r\nJOIN US! \r\n\r\nEnjoy Realore Games at: http://www.realore.com \r\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealoreGame \r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealoreGames \r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.realore.com/appprivacypolicy.php","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N6G3ZTH7771","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO SENGOKU 3","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27765.14019271281443360.c85dae28-d0bd-41ec-b276-abdd2db7464e.9a4e6502-e00e-4f06-b674-74b411b2e3ec","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18756.14019271281443360.c85dae28-d0bd-41ec-b276-abdd2db7464e.ef9b4120-a6e1-489d-bb4b-12456c76361c","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1139.14019271281443360.c85dae28-d0bd-41ec-b276-abdd2db7464e.14eda89f-0c82-438a-9b61-b2346003446d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63204.14019271281443360.c85dae28-d0bd-41ec-b276-abdd2db7464e.977d1c1d-df6d-4db7-b687-c01a67874684","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4740.14019271281443360.c85dae28-d0bd-41ec-b276-abdd2db7464e.a4a50bad-bb80-4e2d-a244-343125fac6bb","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£6.09","Price":6.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOSENGOKU3_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["d3a80a82-fe6d-c529-2c7b-fbf765e5b721"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SENGOKU 3 is a side-scrolling action game released by SNK in 2001.

A small dash of logic and you'll be able to solve any puzzle and there will be no limit to your exploratory spirit while interacting with the game's world: fire coconuts from a mammoth's trunk, turn into an animal or save the fair maiden from the Octo-Boss' grasp.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDD8T1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Yatzy Premium","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.17496.9007199266389544.13c81422-75e1-48a2-86cb-7dd25cd23131.5c759605-d2f0-4547-a9be-198837a117d7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#068B5C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.51099.9007199266389544.c4abc8b0-2749-4558-af6f-bed3a7981d5b.9be46e7d-5285-4103-a787-9864e200bec5","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#068B5C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"9","PackageFamilyNames":["37936Larocque.YatzyPremium_kgerrer9nxtm4"],"ContentIds":["01b511df-67ff-c960-5870-eee5bc385e83"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Yatzy Premium is an addictive and exciting dice game.

Their first book of fairytales that was published back in 1812 included about 200 fairy tales making those brothers one of the most famous storytellers of folk tales, which made stories like 'Cinderella', 'The Frog Prince', 'Hansel and Gretel', 'Rapunzel', Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' to be well-known all around the world. Even though it is known that those tales are collected, there are numerous discussions about the ideology behind those tales sometimes being criticized for the certain note of violence and crudity that appears in some of the stories while others debate about the possibility of including real situations when the brothers were editing those stories.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are philologists that work in one of the most interesting clubs in the world. They have job as many of us would dream of. Namely this time they got a task to discover if the brothers Grimm's fairytales are based on true stories or they are simply part of someone's fantasy, no matter if brothers Grimm's or the fantasy of the folk storyteller, taken in general.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are at the moment in the land where they hope that was the land where actually happened the story about Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Denis and Ralph enter into this adventure being objective, without any expectations and that's why they would be very surprised by the objects they will find there.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4P1KZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hardwood Euchre","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18515.13510798887478832.30a8f989-30ad-488f-9cfe-b38abb36f3bb.62990af4-e2fb-4964-94e7-2ad0fef4cb0f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57366.13510798887478832.9b26b0a3-63ca-4b6f-a223-d2fc4c95f10e.3a1e3110-aaf1-4c20-a38f-f4ab28d64462","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16336.13510798887478832.deea14f2-28ff-4f62-a6ee-73bb0d848729.d3d769c2-a581-4e1c-8a3c-84f6567b0304","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33243.13510798887478832.e36f355d-f69b-4154-a585-f5c40213bc96.213776c2-caa0-40f5-b495-30c00ece8f01","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57366.13510798887478832.9b26b0a3-63ca-4b6f-a223-d2fc4c95f10e.3a1e3110-aaf1-4c20-a38f-f4ab28d64462","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"9","PackageFamilyNames":["SilverCreekEntertainment.HardwoodEuchre_8yfesc7tqxj5w"],"ContentIds":["19713780-a05f-d1e4-ade0-e1a0d13e1ef1","f14f5104-be84-64e1-1def-5b99b8038456"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Hardwood Euchre is customizable with fun backgrounds, cards, player avatars and tables that can be added to the game via paid downloadable content.\r\n\r\nSpecially designed for tablets and phones, this free Euchre card game breathes new life into your favorite game with excellent graphics.

Your kids can hand Tommy a skateboard to make him go faster as they become comfortable with blending the sounds.\r\n\r\n- With Skateboards and Helmets children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets.\r\n\r\n- In Turn the Blocks kids make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.\r\n\r\n- Through Word Ball children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball.\r\n\r\n- With Word Magic kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen\r\n\r\n- In Rocket Words children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space\r\n\r\nIf your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our Kids ABC Phonics app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Kids ABC Letters app.\r\n\r\nEvery section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning. Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time - and learning.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NGJ9G27T3NQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Voodoo: Kick the Buddy","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26554.13644904397619589.e77b1ce6-a69d-4485-8b13-b5625cdc2d57.b26cfbb6-0463-4509-8845-d40b2f96e43c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9602.13644904397619589.e77b1ce6-a69d-4485-8b13-b5625cdc2d57.ac84370b-2c6e-4db4-9c80-bfefbc77fca4","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26554.13644904397619589.e77b1ce6-a69d-4485-8b13-b5625cdc2d57.b26cfbb6-0463-4509-8845-d40b2f96e43c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.6,"RatingsCount":"16","PackageFamilyNames":["50978NinjaCraftBestGames.VoodooKicktheBuddy_3yexm47kcmdje"],"ContentIds":["49622a35-6ddf-7e50-c0f2-e2d963278655"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"KICK THE BUDDY ARRIVES ON WINDOWS STORE!\r\n\r\nExplode, destroy, fire, shoot, smash, freeze, send the power of the Gods and don't even think about stopping!

The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit. \r\n✓\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9. \r\n✓\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit.\r\n✓\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9.\r\n✓\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit.\r\n✓\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit.\r\n✓\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit.\r\n✓\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points.\r\n✓\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made.\r\n✓\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre.\r\n✓\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred.\r\n✓\tThe makers are marked with an M.

It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH35R2N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Prince of Persia PC","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.14559.13510798885215795.33ab9d7d-6a3a-433a-ae2d-3d1f2a7de8b7.22bbcd71-f951-4cb8-aa35-45f739935387","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.1112.13510798885215795.0a543528-b48b-434a-9faf-75f2c1a219f7.37be0280-9415-4fe8-99e9-4301ba6aa133","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18011.13510798885215795.2cc7c918-21cd-4664-8cb7-9ce694c6f821.f4fdf113-be9a-4717-90af-75b7cd425fc0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.2,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["4235VladimirKuznetsov.PrinceofPersiaPC_dezqr7eax3k0g"],"ContentIds":["1ca85be4-eb7e-bc48-faf2-fee3eae33568","25f19eae-cdf2-90c4-56c3-4fe48747764b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The classic DOS game.

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

people of Rend for quite some time and no one has ever managed to put an end to his evil reign.\r\n\r\nAs one of the few mighty heroes of the realm, you've been tasked to enter Lord Slyn's dungeon and kill him to stop all the suffering he's caused bringing peace to the entire land.\r\n\r\nAs easy as it may sound, this will prove to be one of the most dangerous challenges you've ever encountered, and you'll have to use your wits to hope that you'll get out alive. Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCB0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Northern Tale","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29127.9007199266251631.467b6a61-1c57-4adb-a2d9-ae3115310276.9e5adcfb-c049-4a97-85e6-0a8bc0b9be5b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1918.9007199266251631.f46aa2f5-dd3b-4e68-b578-9b2598f1c47b.6c5d77e7-77de-4f3c-a96d-3b49b6ea4ada","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"111","PackageFamilyNames":["780F5C7B.NorthernTale_0gmyx1dmsk3dw"],"ContentIds":["1774bcc8-0b17-e3e3-c331-bf11845a0c18"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Black Friday: The full version is on  LIMITED TIME SALE!

After all, they have so many beneficial vitamins. And each of them is unlike the other. Red, blue, and green, large and small, hard and soft. Some are sweet, others sour, and still more are salty. You might think that each fruit has its own personality. Merry strawberries, clumsy cabbages, and carefree oranges. I wonder what they would be like if they could live among us? We decided to indulge our imaginations and presented each fruit in its own characteristic way. The result turned out to be very interesting and fun!\r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NFPQMZ0NQ4J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Find The Hidden Objects","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52114.13590719307799303.deaad7f2-5760-4f97-9566-e4c790462281.ba7d760f-d7c6-4d27-93d6-f677caef0a14","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39270.13590719307799303.deaad7f2-5760-4f97-9566-e4c790462281.b81a8094-117a-412a-92a8-9cc10af2763d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20759.13590719307799303.deaad7f2-5760-4f97-9566-e4c790462281.05b99116-b683-4454-8632-f71b9e9974fe","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.49","Price":1.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["61643PlayEverydayGames.FindTheHiddenObjects_fvk8tmxh6cs7a"],"ContentIds":["771774a2-2ba0-17cd-9fe6-86472b1a5eaa","0f375170-e19c-4914-ad06-e10024ac11c3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Can you Find all the Hidden Toys?\r\n\r\nThe game principle is simple: Find a series of Mystery Toys hidden objects in a scene!\r\nHidden Objects Mystery Toys is a challenging puzzle game to test hidden power of you brain and visual skills in a time constrained game play.\r\n\r\nMystery Toys Hidden Objects is a free game about to test your strategy, you will be challenged like never before!

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDC3H3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Chess Riddles Deluxe","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39369.9007199266355838.d5978be6-8d6f-4ca0-b234-267ed3cb6606.8d4dde73-e708-474f-a413-59ead3e368dd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57187.9007199266355838.da5af03e-aafc-46e5-a497-d36e143c59cb.10e91416-204f-4715-9375-cc0fb5e33425","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"19","PackageFamilyNames":["19506NektariosGiannoulis.ChessRiddlesDeluxe_8nyed6ycj0kqg"],"ContentIds":["90aad5ef-70e0-f048-ca64-d74ef376401a","48d87b1e-2b0d-e010-5913-264ef0035366"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Can you place eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other?

Protect the stronghold of the Dark Forces from the onslaught of hostile armies of Light!\r\n\r\nNOTICE: If you have problems running the game please contact us (and please specify your device model): wp7.smartpixgames@gmail.com\r\nFAQ: http://www.smartpixgames.com/faq.php#p10\r\nPromo video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRz9-Zf0flk\r\n\r\nIn the full version of Myth Defense: Dark Forces:\r\n- 4 maps + random map in battle mode\r\n- campaign: 10 + 50 missions and 2 modes to pass it: Normal and Heroic\r\n- achievements, increasing amount of Glory Points for mission\r\n- different skills improvement \r\n- 22 types of towers and 3 types of traps in 3 technological branches (Orcs, Necromancers, Goblins)\r\n- special features of monsters and towers\r\n- runes to make towers stronger, and Alchemy to create runes\r\n- terrain features: difficult terrain, moving platforms, etc.\r\n- 40 levels of hardness. The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically.
